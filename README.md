# RNN News Classification This repository contains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for classifying news articles using the AG News dataset. The model is pre-trained and can be tested interactively through a Jupyter Notebook widget. ## Installation ### Prerequisites - Python 3.10 or higher - `pip` ### Steps 1. **Clone the repository**: ```sh git clone https://github.com/DarkArmy66/rnn_news_prediction.git cd rnn_news_prediction ``` 2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended): ```sh python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate ``` 3. **Install dependencies**: ```sh pip install -r requirements.txt ``` 4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: ```sh jupyter notebook ``` 5. **Open and run the demo notebook**: - Navigate to `notebooks/demo.ipynb` - Run all the cells to load the model and interact with the widget. ## Usage - **Type** a news article in the text box. - **Click** the "Predict" button to see the predicted news category. ## Model - The RNN model is trained on the AG News dataset and saved as `models/rnn_model.pth`. - The model architecture is defined in `src/model.py`.
